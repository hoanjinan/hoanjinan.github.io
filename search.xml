Or maybe how autocorrect on your phone knows what you’re trying to type?  In this post, we’ll cover some basics of natural language processing like reading in and creating structure in messy text data, and then cleaning and tokenizing that data.  Then the post will cover some of the more advanced topics like lemmatising, stemming, and vectorizing the data.  In other words, converting it from text into a numeric matrix.  The post do this with a focus on preparing the data to build a machine learning classifier on top of it.  The post will also learn how to build two different types of machine learning models, while thoroughly testing and evaluating different variations of those models.  We’ll have the tools to go from messy dataset to concise and accurate predictions from machine learning model, to deliver solutions to complex business problems.</p><h2 id="introduction-to-natural-language-processing-nlp"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introduction-to-natural-language-processing-nlp"></a> Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2><p>Natural language processing is a field concerned with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language. By human language, we’re simply referring to any language used for everyday communication.  This can be English, Spanish, French, anything like that.  Now it’s worth noting that Python doesn’t naturally know what any given word means.  All it will see is a string of characters.  For instance, it has no idea what natural actually means.  It sees that it’s seven characters long, but the individual characters don’t mean anything to Python and certainly the collection of those characters together don’t mean anything, either.  So we know that, what an N is, what an A is, and we know that together, those seven characters makes up the word natural, and we know what that means.  So NLP is the field of getting the computer to understand what naturally actually signifies, and from there we can get into the manipulation or potentially even generation of that human language.</p><p>You probably experience natural language processing on a daily basis.  They may not really even know it.  So here are a few examples that you may see on a day to day basis.  The first would be a spam filter, so this is just where your email server is determining whether an incoming email is spam or not, based on the content of the body, the subject, and maybe the email domain.  The second is auto-complete, where Google is basically predicting what you’re interested in searching for based on what you’ve already entered and what others commonly search for with those same phrases.  So if I search for natural language processing, it knows that many other people are interested in learning NLP with Python, or learning it through a course, or looking for jobs related to natural language processing.  So it can auto-complete your search for you.  The last is auto-correct, where say iPhone is trying to help you correct a misspelling. It shows how auto-correct has actually evolved over time and continues to evolve and learn by upgrading the operating system.  So with iOS 6, if you’re trying to say, “I’ll be ill tomorrow,” It wouldn’t necessarily correct I’ll be I’ll tomorrow until iOS 7, where it actually corrects, it auto-completes tomorrow and corrects I’ll into ill.  So it’ll correctly send as I’ll be ill tomorrow.  So that just kind of shows how NLP is still evolving and how a system like iOS is still kind of learning what natural language even means.</p><p>Now NLP is a very broad umbrella that encompasses many topics. A few of those might be sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and sentence segmentation or part-or-speech tagging.  The core component of natural language processing is extracting all the information from a block of text that is relevant to a computer understanding the language.  This is task specific, as well.  Different information is relevant for a sentiment analysis task than is relevant for a topic modeling task. So that’s a very quick introduction into what natural language processing is.</p><h2 id="introduction-to-nltk"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introduction-to-nltk"></a> Introduction to NLTK</h2><p>The natural language toolkit is the most utilized package for handling natural language processing tasks in Python.  Usually called NLTK for short, it is a suite of open-source tools originally created in 2001 at the University of Pennsylvania for the purpose of making building NLP processes in Python easier.  This package has been expanded through the extensive contributions of open-source users in the years since its original development.  NLTK is great because it basically provides a jumpstart to building any NLP process by giving you the basic tools that you can then chain together to accomplish your goal rather than having to build all those tools from scratch and a lot of tools are packaged into NLTK.</p><h1 id="nlp-basics"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#nlp-basics"></a> NLP Basics</h1><h2 id="how-to-install-nltk-on-local-machine"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#how-to-install-nltk-on-local-machine"></a> How to install NLTK on local machine</h2><p>Both sets of instructions below assume you already have Python installed.

A few examples might be an email, PDF file, social media post, these may just get dumped into a file with no indication of where, maybe, a subject of an email ends and the body of the email begins, or even where one email ends and the next begins.  It could also get cluttered by things like HTML tags and it can get really messy.  It’s important to note that Python is pretty smart, but ultimately, unless it’s told otherwise, it basically sees everything as a string of characters. It needs to be told what those characters mean.</p><h3 id="read-semi-structured-data"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#read-semi-structured-data"></a> Read Semi-structured data</h3><p>The following image presents a semi-structured SMS data:</p><p><img alt="Semi-structured SMS data sample" data-src="/img/NLP/SMS.png" class="lozad"></p><p>This dataset is a collection of text messages, each with a label of either spam or ham.

So if you’re familiar with wildcards for search, like if you wanted to search for any CSV file on your computer using *.csv, this is basically just a supercharged version of that.  Regular expressions can take various forms.</p><p>To give a very quick example of what it means, the regular expression ‘nlp’ will just search for the explicit “nlp” string within some other string.  This isn’t so much a search pattern as it is an explicit command for what we want to find.  So if it was, “I love nlp” then this search pattern would just capture and return “nlp.”  Another way to identify the “nlp” string would be to use the expression ‘[j-q]’.  And this will just search for all single characters between ‘j’ and ‘q’ in whatever text we’re looking at, but this will search for all characters between ‘j’ and ‘q’, not just ‘n’, ‘l’, and ‘p’.  The other consideration here is that this will only return single characters at a time.  So this would return ‘n’ and then ‘l’ and then ‘p’ and also whatever other characters between ‘j’ and ‘q’ in your text string.  This isn’t usually what we’re looking for.  So we can solve that issue of only returning a single character by simply placing a plus sign outside of our brackets like ‘[j-q]+’.  What that will tell Python is that it can search for strings longer than one character.  So what this will look for is any character between ‘j’ and ‘q’, just with the added flexibility of returning strings of multiple characters together that are between ‘j’ and ‘q’.  Switching gears a little bit, ‘[0-9]+’ will return all numbers with the flexibility of returning sequences of more than one number.  So if there’s a year, like 2017, it will return the full year, rather than each number individually.  Then lastly, to combine these two concepts, ‘[j-q0-9]+’ will search for sequences of characters between ‘j’ and ‘q’, or numbers between 0 and 9.  So if you had a course name that was “nlp2017” without any spaces, then it would return that full string, but if you had “nlp 2017” with a space in between them, then that would return them as two separate sequences.  This is just five very quick examples, but there is literally an infinite number of patters that you could come up with.</p><p>Regex give you the power and flexibility to search for almost any kind of pattern you could imagine.  The examples are useful, but why do we actually care about this?  Regexes are particularly useful when dealing with text data because a lot of the data is unstructured, where you need to be able to use these patterns to try to create some structure within the document.  For instance, you could use a regex to identify the white space between words or tokens, or even let Python know how to split up a certain sentence.  Another use is to identify delimiters between columns or end-of-line escape characters that indicate the end of one line and the beginning of another like we saw in our SMS Spam Collection dataset.  They can also be used to remove punctuation or numbers, clean HTML tags, or just identify some random patterns that you’re interested in.  A few examples of regular use cases might be confirming passwords that meet some criteria.  So maybe a company requires one capital letter, one lower case and one special character in their passwords.  You can create a regex to confirm that each new password created matches that criteria.  Then the last three all kind of fall under the same broad category of searching for a certain pattern, like filenames, so find all the CSV’s that meet this criteria, or some portion of a URL, so maybe it’s whatever follows .com or .org, or scraping for key information from a larger document like package version numbers from a technical report.</p><h3 id="how-to-use-regular-expressions"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#how-to-use-regular-expressions"></a> How to Use Regular Expressions</h3><p>The primary reason that we’re talking about regex is in order to tokenize sentences or split a sentence into a list of words so that Python can understand what it needs to be looking at.  Right now, Python just sees a string of characters, so we need to tell it what to focus on, and how to organize those characters.  For our machine learning model, Python will need to split the string into what we call tokens, or words, so that the model can learn how those tokens relate to the corresponse variable.</p><p>Python’s <code>re</code> package is the most commonly used regex resource.

Now that we’ve covered some of the basic regex usage for the purpose of tokenizing, there are a few takeaways to keep in mind. There are two methods from the re package that can be used for tokenizing. findall() will search for the actual words while ignoring the things that separate the words, while split() will search for the characters that split the words while ignoring the actual words themselves. And the regexes that are most useful for tokenizing, keep in mind that anything using a W is based on words, while anything with an S is based on white spaces. In our daily work, it’s much more common to be using the W regex because it allows the flexibility for words to be separated by spaces, or special characters. But having an understanding of what the S offers you is a nice tool to hold in your back pocket.</p><h3 id="regular-expression-replacements"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#regular-expression-replacements"></a> Regular Expression Replacements</h3><p>The following sentances are the examples that we need to capture a section of the sentance and replace with other words:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">pep8_test = <span class="string">'I try to follow PEP8 guidelines'</span></span><br><span class="line">pep7_test = <span class="string">'I try to follow PEP7 guidelines'</span></span><br><span class="line">peep8_test = <span class="string">'I try to follow PEEP8 guidelines'</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We need to replace PEP8, PEP7 and PEEP8 with PEP8 Python Styleguide.

However the point is to illustrate how you can use regex and give a practical example of a case that you might use it in.  So now up to this point we’ve explored three different regex methods with some practical application of how you might use it.  But there are a lot of other regex methods within this repackage.  Few are listed below, so there’s search, match, full match, find itter, and escape.  Even more broadly, the regex that we explored are very, very simple.  They can get very complex.  And the best way to learn it is by defining your own string with the goal of identifying some substring, pull up a regex cheat sheet, and start exploring different patterns to try to identify that substring.</p><h4 id="other-examples-of-regex-methods"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#other-examples-of-regex-methods"></a> Other examples of regex methods</h4><ul><li>re.search()</li><li>re.match()</li><li>re.fullmatch()</li><li>re.finditer()</li><li>re.escape()</li></ul><h2 id="machine-learning-pipeline"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#machine-learning-pipeline"></a> Machine Learning Pipeline</h2><p>Up to this point, we’ve learned some basics of NLP and NLTK.  We’ve learned how to read in messy text, and we’ve learned how to use regular expressions to search for and manipulate that text.  Now, we’ll take a step back to understand how this all fits together in the broader machine learning pipeline before we dive into each step individually.  This section is going to introduce some new topics as well and we’ll cover each of these topics later.  This is meant only to provide the proper context for how this all fits together.</p><p>In a typical machine learning text pipeline, you’ll start with some document with raw text in it, like the SMS data set that we’re working with.  It’s important to note that at this stage, the computer has no idea what it’s looking at.  All it sees is a collection of characters.  It doesn’t know the word ham from the word spam.  The characters mean nothing.  It doesn’t even know a space from a number or a letter.  They’re all the same.</p><p>So the first thing we need to do is tokenize our text.  We did this earlier in this chapter by splitting on white space or special characters.  So you would take the sentence, “I am learning NLP,” and it would split into a list with four tokens, I and then am and then learning, and lastly NLP.  So now, instead of just seeing one long string of characters like it was seeing before, now Python will see a list with four distinct tokens, so it knows what to look at.  So now we have a list of tokens, so Python knows what to look at.</p><p>However, some of the words might be a little bit more important than other words.  For instance, the words the, and, of, or, appear very frequently but don’t really offer much information about the sentence itself.  These are what’s called stop words.  We took a quick look at these earlier in this post.  Typically, you will remove these words to allow Python to really focus in on the most pivotal words in our sentence.  So in the example we used previously, instead of a list with I, am, learning, NLP, once you remove stop words, now you’re just left with learning and NLP.  This still gets across the most important point of the sentence, but now you’re only looking at half the amount of tokens.  Also, the process of stemming helps Python realize that words like learn, learned and learning all have basically the same semantic meaning.  You may not think this is a big deal, and in a small sample it’s really not, but when you all of a sudden have a million text messages, and a corpus of 150,000 words, any words that you can remove to allow Python to focus on the most pivotal words can really make a big difference.</p><p>So now Python sees a list of tokens you care about, and the key words that we think are useful for building some kind of machine learning model.  Even though Python now knows what you care about, it still only sees characters.  It doesn’t know what learning or NLP even means.  So we have to convert it to a format that a machine learning algorithm can actually ingest and use to build a model.  This is a process called vectorizing.  It’s basically converting the text to a numeric representation of that text, where you are essentially counting the occurrences of each word in each text message using a matrix with one row per text message and one column per word.</p><p>So that you have this numeric matrix, you can now fit your actual machine learning model by feeding in your vectorized data along with your spam or ham labels.  The model will then learn the relationships between the words and the labels in order to train a model to make predictions on text messages that it has never seen before and determine whether they are spam or not.  There are various types of machine learning models.  It will be up to you to select a few of them to try out.  You’ll tailor your choices based on the type of input data you’re giving it, what you’re trying to predict, how much compute power you have, things like that.  You’ll typically test out a number of what’s called candidate models before selecting which model performs best.  Once you select the best model, you’ll evaluate that on a holdout test set, and this is typically a set of data that you’ll set off to the side in the very beginning for the purpose of testing your final model on it to see how your model will perform on data that it’s never seen or touched before.  If it passes this final test, then you’ll prepare to implement it within whatever framework you’re working with.  In this example, it’s an illustration of a spam filter, trying to filter out whether incoming email is spam or not.</p><h2 id="implementation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#implementation"></a> Implementation</h2><p>In the previous part, we put those together at a conceptual level, laying out what the full machine learning pipeline looks like.  In this part, we’re going to actually write the code to handle to cleaning portion, or the pre-processing as it’s typically referred to, of this machine learning program.  There are four steps below that you’ll see in a lot of text cleaning pipelines: <strong>removing the punctuation, tokenization, removing stop words, and lemmatising or stemming</strong>.  We’re going to focus on the first three steps in this session, then we’ll cover lemmatising and stemming in the next chapter of the post, as those are a little bit more advanced and not implemented in every pipeline.</p><p>The following sample is our target output for all:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># What does the cleaned version look like?</span></span><br><span class="line">data_cleaned = pd.read_csv(<span class="string">"SMSSpamCollection_cleaned.tsv"</span>, sep=<span class="string">'\t'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">data_cleaned.head()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center"></th><th style="text-align:center">label</th><th style="text-align:center">body_text</th><th style="text-align:center">body_text_nostop</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">0</td><td style="text-align:center">ham</td><td style="text-align:center">I’ve been searching for the right words to thank you for this breather.

The reason that we care about this is that periods, parentheses, and other punctuation look like just another character to Python.  But realistically, the period doesn’t really help pull the meaning out of a sentence.  In the following example, for us “I like NLP.”, with a period, is exactly the same as, “I like NLP”.  They mean the same thing to us, but when you give that to Python, Python says those are not equivalent things.  And Python isn’t saying “I like NLP” without a period is different than “I like NLP.”  With a period, in that they’re really close, but one has a period and one doesn’t.  To Python, these might was well be “I like NLP” versus “I hate NLP”.  It knows they’re different without any ability to understand how different they are.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="string">"I like NLP."</span> == <span class="string">"I like NLP"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="literal">False</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>There is the function to remove the punctuation:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> re</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">remove_punctuation</span><span class="params">(text)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Check if a character is in string punctuationk, if it is not, return this charactor</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># and the join all characters together by using "".join</span></span><br><span class="line">    text_nopunct = <span class="string">""</span>.join(char <span class="keyword">for</span> char <span class="keyword">in</span> text <span class="keyword">if</span> char <span class="keyword">not</span> <span class="keyword">in</span> string.punctuation)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> text_nopunct</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment"># This is going to apply our lambda function to each row of body_text</span></span><br><span class="line">data[<span class="string">"body_text_clean"</span>] = data[<span class="string">"body_text"</span>].apply(<span class="keyword">lambda</span> x : remove_punctuation(x))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">data.head()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center"></th><th style="text-align:center">label</th><th style="text-align:center">body_text</th><th style="text-align:center">body_text_nostop</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">0</td><td style="text-align:center">ham</td><td style="text-align:center">I’ve been searching for the right words to thank you for this breather.

After tokenizing, it would have four tokens, I, am, learning, and NLP.  Then after removing stopwords, instead of a list with four tokens, you’re now left with just learning and NLP.

So that is a very abbreviated look at what a pre-processing pipeline looks like as you’re preparing to get your raw text into a format that a machine learning model can actually use. In the next chapter, we’ll explore some extra, slightly more advanced cleaning techniques and concepts that we can apply to our text to further help a machine learning model focus on the things that are really important.</p><h1 id="supplemental-data-cleaning"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#supplemental-data-cleaning"></a> Supplemental Data Cleaning</h1><h2 id="introducting-stemming"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introducting-stemming"></a> Introducting Stemming</h2><p>The formal definition of stemming is the process of reducing inflected or derived words to their word stem or root.  More simply put, the process of stemming means often crudely chopping off the end of a word, to leave only the base.  So this means taking words with various suffixes and condensing them under the same root word.  Recall when we removed stop words, it was to reduce the number of words Python has to look at or consider.  Stemming is shooting for the same goal by reducing variations of the same root word.</p><p>Examples:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">before</th><th style="text-align:center">after</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">Stemming / stemmed</td><td style="text-align:center">Stem</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Electricity / electrical</td><td style="text-align:center">Electr</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Berries / berry</td><td style="text-align:center">berri</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">Connection / connected / connective</td><td style="text-align:center">Connect</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So this seems pretty useful, but stemming uses very crude rules, so it isn’t perfect.  For instance, look at meaning and meanness.  These words aren’t really all that closely related, but they’ll be both stripped down to a base of mean.  And thus Python will think that meanness and meaning are the same exact thing.  So stemmers are correct in most cases, but the trade-off with these simple rules is that it won’t always be right.</p><p>So this all seems interesting, but why do we really care about this?  Why does this actually help us for model building?  If Python sees grew, grow, and growing as three separate things, that means it has to keep those three separate words in memory.  Imagine every variation of every root word.  Maybe we have a thousand root words, but in our corpus, we have two thousand total words with every suffix added to the root words.  The alternative in this grew, grow, and growing example is applying the stemmer, and now it only has to know what grow means, as each variation of grow is replaced simply by grow.  So Python has to look at a lot more tokens without a stemmer and it doesn’t know that these separate tokens are even related.  So the benefits of a stemmer is <strong>it reduces the corpus of words the model is exposed to</strong>, so it’s just grow, instead of grew, grow, and growing, and <strong>it explicitly correlates words with similar meaning</strong>.  So Python could learn through the training process that we’ll discuss later, that grow, grew, and growing are similar in meaning, but it also may not, it depends on a lot of different factors.  In this case, we’re not leaving it up to Python.  We’re being explicit by replacing similar words with just one common root word.  There are a number of different types of stemmers that use various algorithms and methods to generate the stemmed version of words.  A few that are included in the NLTK package are the <strong>Porter Stemmer, the Snowball Stemmer, the Lancaster Stemmer, and a Regex-Based Stemmer</strong>. We’ll be focusing on the most popular stemmer in this list, the <strong>Porter Stemmer</strong>.</p><h2 id="using-stemming"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#using-stemming"></a> Using Stemming</h2><p>To make the use of stemming, there are two stages.  First, we’ll test out the stemmer on specific words to understand how it works.  Then we’ll apply the stemmer on the SMS spam collection data set to further clean up our data.</p><p>Import package:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> nltk</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">ps = nltk.PorterStemmer()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>First example of using the function:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"grows"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"growing"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"grow"</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">grow</span><br><span class="line">grow</span><br><span class="line">grow</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So that reduces them all to the proper root word of grow.  So now these three words can be treated as the same word, rather than Python seeing them as three distinctly different words.</p><p>We showed before how the stemmer isn’t perfect, where it stemmed both meaning and meanness down to mean, even though they don’t represent the same thing.  However, if you look at a different example that could be a little difficult, we’ll do run, running, and runner.  You could see how all three of these might be reduced down to just run. Even though the first two are actions and the last one describes a person.</p><p>Second example of using the function:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"run"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"running"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"runner"</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">run</span><br><span class="line">run</span><br><span class="line">runner</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So the stemmer can actually tell that the first two are different than the last one in some way.

So it’s probably not a great fit for a text message data set.  To be noticed that entry is changed to entri with an i so it could also accommodate plural, entries.  Same thing with wkli.  Another one is on the second line, lives is reduced down to live.  So, we know what stemming represents, and how to actually apply it.  Stemming helps us reduce the corpus of words that the models are exposed to, and it explicitly correlates words with similar meaning.</p><h2 id="introducting-lemmatising"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introducting-lemmatising"></a> Introducting Lemmatising</h2><p>The formal definition is that it’s the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single term, identified by the word’s lemma.  The lemma is the canonical form of a set of words.  For instance, type, typed, and typing would all be forms of the same lemma.  More simply put, lemmatising is using vocabulary analysis of words to remove inflectional endings and return to the dictionary form of a word.  So again, type, typed, and typing would all be simplified down to type, because that’s the root of the word.  Each variation carries the same meaning just with slightly different tense.  So you might be thinking that that sounds an awful lot like stemming, and you wouldn’t be wrong.  They are aiming to accomplish the same thing, but they are doing it in just slightly different ways.  And in practical terms, there’s an accuracy and speed trade-off that you’re making when you opt for one over the other.</p><p>The goal of both is to condense derived words down into their base form, to reduce the corpus of words that the model’s exposed to, and to explicitly correlate words with similar meaning.  The difference is that stemming takes a more crude approach by just chopping off the ending of a word using heuristics, without any understanding of the context in which a word is used.  Because of that, stemming may or may not return an actual word in the dictionary.  And it’s usually less accurate, but the benefit is that it’s faster because the rules are quite simple.  lemmatising leverages more informed analysis to create groups of words with similar meaning based on the context around the word, part of speech, and other factors.  lemmatisers will always return a dictionary word.  And because of the additional context it’s considered, this is typically more accurate.  But the downside is that it may be more computationally expensive.  So this is a very brief introduction into lemmatising.</p><h2 id="using-lemmatising"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#using-lemmatising"></a> Using Lemmatising</h2><p>To make the use of Lemmatising, there are two stages.  First, we’re going to test out the lemmatiser on specific words to understand how it works and then we’ll apply it on the SMS Spam Collection Data Set to further clean it up.  So the same process that we saw on the stemming notebook.  Just like we saw with stemmers, there are a few different lemmatisers as well that handle words in slightly different ways.  So we’re going to use the WordNet lemmatiser. This is probably the most popular lemmatiser.  WordNet is a collection of nouns, verbs, adjective and adverbs that are grouped together in sets of synonyms, each expressing a distinct concept.  This lemmatiser runs off of this corpus of synonyms, so given a word, it will track that word to its synonyms, and then the distinct concept that that group of words represents.</p><h3 id="test-out-wordnet-lemmatiser-read-more-about-wordnet-here"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#test-out-wordnet-lemmatiser-read-more-about-wordnet-here"></a> Test out WordNet lemmatiser (read more about WordNet <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)</h3><p>Import the nltk package and apply both lemmatiser and stemmer function:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> nltk</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">wn = nltk.WordNetlemmatiser()</span><br><span class="line">ps = nltk.PorterStemmer()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="comparation-between-lemmatiser-and-stemmer"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#comparation-between-lemmatiser-and-stemmer"></a> Comparation between Lemmatiser and Stemmer</h3><h4 id="first-example"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#first-example"></a> First Example</h4><p>Stemmer:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"meanness"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"meaning"</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mean</span><br><span class="line">mean</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As we have mentioned that, meanness and meaning are different but stemmer still cuts off and return root words for both words.</p><p>Lemmartiser:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(wn.lemmatise(<span class="string">"meanness"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(wn.lemmatise(<span class="string">"meaning"</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">meanness</span><br><span class="line">meaning</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Two things need to be highlighted here.  First, stemming uses the algorithmic approach so it’s only concerned with the string that it’s given, and it will essentially chop off the suffix.  lemmatising is a little bit more complex in that it searches the corpus to find related words and condense it down to the core concept.  The problem is that if this word isn’t in the corpus, then it will just return the original word, so that’s what’s happening in this example.  With that said, not condensing it in this case is probably better than incorrectly stemming it using the Porter stemmer.</p><h4 id="second-example"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#second-example"></a> Second Example</h4><p>Stemmer:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"goose"</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(ps.stem(<span class="string">"geese"</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Output:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">goos</span><br><span class="line">gees</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>You can see that the stemmer doesn’t quite know what to do here with goose and geese so it returns two different root words.

It might be much more effective if it was used on a collection of book reports or journal articles.  There are a couple things that the lemmatiser was able to impact.  It transitioned this lives down into life, and it also transitioned mobiles into mobile, and so you’ll notice that these aren’t super interesting examples necessarily, but as you saw above, the lemmatiser can do some relatively sophisticated things, at least more sophisticated than the stemmer.  Now you’ve learned what lemmatising is, and how to actually apply it, so both stemming and lemmatising helps us reduce the corpus of words that the model is exposed to, and it explicitly correlates words with similar meaning.  The lemmatiser is typically more accurate than the stemmer but the trade-off is that it takes a little bit longer to run.  Based on your machine learning pipeline, if the lemmatiser is going to be a bottleneck, then you may opt for the more simple stemmer.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction-to-the-post"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introduction-to-the-post"></a> Introduction to The Post</h1><p>This post is going to describe how to use the Apache Spark Platform for Machine Learning.  It will start by reviewing the basics of the dataframe data structure.  Then, it will cover the pre-processing to both numeric and text data so that is ready to use with Spark’s MLlib machine learning library.  The post will also describe multiple algorithms for clustering, classification and regression.  In the end, it will briefly describe a recommendation system.</p><h1 id="introduction-to-spark"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introduction-to-spark"></a> Introduction to Spark</h1><p>Spark is a distributed, data processing platform for big data.  Distributed means Spark runs on a cluster of servers and the data processing means it performs computations such as ETL and modelling.  In the case of Spark, some of the most interesting computations are related to machine learning and data analysis.  Big data is a term broadly applied to data sets that are not easily analyzed on a single server or using older data management systems that were designed to run on a single server.  Spark is becoming increasingly polyglot with support for multiple languages.  Software engineers familiar with Scala and Java can use those languages while data scientists who prefer Python and R can work with those languages.</p><p>This post will use Python as programming language.  Spark uses a modular architecture that allows for multiple components or packages.  These include MLlib for machine learning, Spark SQL for relational querying, Spark Streaming for continuous processing of streaming data, and GraphX for graph analysis, such as social network analysis.  Spark is a generalized computation platform designed to manage large data sets.  It’s found use in a wide number of industries and applications, including real-time monitoring of financial data, text analysis related to competitive intelligence and compliance, analyzing how customers use eCommerce sites, and healthcare applications, such as analyzing genomes.</p><h1 id="steps-in-machine-learning-process"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#steps-in-machine-learning-process"></a> Steps in Machine Learning Process</h1><p>There are three broad steps in the machine learning process.</p><p>The first is preprocessing, which includes collecting, reformatting, and transforming data, so that it’s readily used by machine learning algorithms.</p><p>The second step is model building, in which machine learning algorithms are applied to training data to build models.  Models are pieces of code that capture the information implicit in training data.</p><p>The last step is validation, in which to measure how well models are performing.  There are multiple ways to measure performance.  The preprocessing phase includes extracting, transforming, and loading data.  This is similar to the ETL process used in business intelligence and data warehousing.</p><h1 id="creating-spark-session-and-basic-dataframe-processing"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor"

has three types of functions.</p><p>The first is machine learning algorithms.  The set of algorithms currently includes algorithms for classifications, which is for categorizing something, such as a customer likely to leave for a competitor.  Regression, which is used for predicting a numeric value like a home price.  Clustering is used to group similar items together.  Unlike classification, there are no predefined groups, so this is really useful when exploring data.  Finally, there’s topic modeling, which is a way to identify themes in a text.</p><p>The second group is workflows.  Workflow components help organize commonly used steps, like pre-processing operations and tuning.  This makes it easy to run a sequence of steps repeatedly while varying some parameters of the process.</p><p>Utilities are lower level functions that give you access to distributed linear algebra and statistics functions.</p><h1 id="introduction-to-preprocessing"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introduction-to-preprocessing"></a> Introduction to Preprocessing</h1><p>There are two types of pre-processing, numeric and text pre-processing.</p><h2 id="numeric"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#numeric"></a> Numeric</h2><h3 id="normalisation-minmaxscaler"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#normalisation-minmaxscaler"></a> Normalisation (MinMaxScaler)</h3><p>Normalising maps data values from their original range to the range of zero to one.  It’s used to avoid problems when some attributes have large ranges and others have small ranges.  For example, salaries have a large range, but years of employment has a small range.</p><h3 id="standardisation-standardscaler"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#standardisation-standardscaler"></a> Standardisation (StandardScaler)</h3><p>Standardising maps data values from their original range to a range of negative one to one and it also has a mean value of zero.  This transformation creates a normal distribution with a standard deviation of one.  This transforms our data into a bell curve shape formation.  It’s used when attributes have different scales, and the machine learning algorithm you’re using assumes a normal distribution.</p><h3 id="partition-bucketiser"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#partition-bucketiser"></a> Partition (Bucketiser)</h3><p>Partitioning maps data values from continuous values to buckets, like histograms.  Deciles and percentiles are examples of buckets.  It’s useful when you want to work with groups of values instead of a continuous range of values.</p><h2 id="text"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#text"></a> Text</h2><h3 id="tokenisation-tokeniser"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#tokenisation-tokeniser"></a> Tokenisation (Tokeniser)</h3><p>This transformation maps text from a single string to a set of tokens, or words.

This transformation is widely used in text classification.  TF-IDF captures the intuition that infrequently used words are more useful for distinguishing categories of text than frequently used words.</p><h1 id="introduction-to-clustering"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#introduction-to-clustering"></a> Introduction to Clustering</h1><p>Often when working with new data sets, it helps to explore the data and look for macro-level structures such as broad clusters of data.  Clustering algorithms group data into clusters that allow us to see how large data sets can break down into distinct subgroups.  K-means is widely used and works well for finding clusters in small and mid-sized data sets.  For large data sets, the Bisecting K-means algorithms can be faster.</p><h2 id="k-means-clustering"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#k-means-clustering"></a> K-means

href="#understand-recommendation-systems"></a> Understand Recommendation Systems</h1><p>A common problem in machine learning is making recommendations.  There’s two general ways of doing this.  One is called Collaborative Filtering. Let’s imagine you run an online bookstore, and you have a number of customers.  And these customers all like reading both the brown book and the red book.  Now a new customer comes along and indicates that they really enjoyed reading the red book.  What other books can we recommend to them? Definitely the brown book, since other people who have read the red book also enjoy reading the brown book.  This is an example of collaborative filtering.  Another way to make recommendations is based on the properties of the items that you’re working with. For example, if we have a customer who really enjoys readying Sci-fi, we might want to recommend other science fiction books to them, but not necessarily biographies.  Spark MLlib supports Collaborative Filtering, and it works by filling in something known as the user-item matrix.  So we can think of users as customers and items as books.  In this example below, we have a customer who likes item one and two and item four.  User number two, or customer number two, also likes item two and also likes item three.  Now, we’ll notice that user four has something in common with both user one and user three.  That means we probably want to recommend item two to user four.  This is an example of collaborative filtering.  This is the type of recommendation system that Spark MLlib supports.</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center"></th><th style="text-align:center">Item1</th><th style="text-align:center">Item2</th><th style="text-align:center">Item3</th><th style="text-align:center">Item4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center">User1</td><td style="text-align:center">x</td><td style="text-align:center">x</td><td style="text-align:center"></td><td style="text-align:center">x</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">User1</td><td style="text-align:center"></td><td style="text-align:center">x</td><td style="text-align:center">x</td><td style="text-align:center"></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">User1</td><td style="text-align:center"></td><td style="text-align:center"></td><td style="text-align:center"></td><td style="text-align:center">x</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center">User1</td><td style="text-align:center">x</td><td style="text-align:center">?</td><td style="text-align:center">x</td><td style="text-align:center"></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="collaborative-filtering"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#collaborative-filtering"></a> Collaborative Filtering</h2><p>Collaborative filtering follows the same patterns we’ve used repeatedly in this post.</p><p>First we start with preprocessing.  We’re going to use the alternating least squares method that’s provided by Spark MLlib, and, to use that, we just import the ALS code from pyspark.ml.recommendation package.  And then we build a DataFrame using user-item ratings.</p><p>When it comes to modeling, we create an ALS object and, when we do that, we have to specify the user, the item, and the rating columns in our data frames.  And then we train the model using fit and fit is part of the ALS project.  And then when it’s time to evaluate, we create predictions using the transform of the ALS model and we apply that to our test data.  We create a RegressionEvaluator object and we use the evaluate function of that RegressionEvaluator object to calculate the root mean squared error, and that’ll give us a measure of how well our collaborative filtering is making recommendations.</p><h1 id="tips-for-using-spark-mllib"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#tips-for-using-spark-mllib"></a> Tips for Using Spark MLlib</h1><p>Let’s review some tips for working with Spark MLlib.</p><p>There are three basic stages of building machine learning models.  There’s a pre-processing phase where we collect, reformat, and transform the data.  And once we have that data, we can build our models using a variety of machine learning algorithms.  And then we want to make sure we evaluate our data to assess the quality of the models we built.</p><p>With that framework in mind, let’s look at some tips to make each of these stages go smoothly. First, when we’re pre-processing, we want to first load our data into DataFrames.  If you’re working with text files, it helps to have headers or column names in the text file.  When you read a file, make sure you use the inferSchema = True option.  That’ll make sure that things like dates and numeric values get mapped to their appropriate data type.  Use the VectorAssembler to create feature vectors and the StringIndexer to map from strings to numeric indexes.</p><p>During the model building phase, make sure to split your data into training and test sets. We use the training data to fit our models and then the test data to apply transformations to create predictions.  When we’re done building the model, we want to validate them.  Using the MLlib evaluators is recommanded.  The two that we looked at were the MulticlassClassificationEvaluator and the RegressionEvaluator.  Just be sure to use the right one for the kind of algorithm you’re working with.  Also, be sure to experiment with multiple algorithms.  Once you’ve gone through the pre-processing phase, it’s very easy to test other algorithms so take advantage of that.  Also, vary hyperparameters for the algorithms you’re working with.  Sometimes you can get slightly better performance just by changing a hyperparameter.</p><p>Where do we go from here? Well first I’d recommend consulting the MLlib documentation.  It’s really high quality documentation and it provides details on the APIs and includes extensive examples.  When you’re ready to work with other data sets, look at the Kaggle website that has both machine learning data sets and articles about machine learning.  Now Spark is designed for working with big data so if you’re ready to work with machine learning at big data scales, consult the AWS data sets.  These are public data sets that are freely available from the AWS cloud service.  Spark and MLlib are both under active development. So as you go forward working with MLlib, be sure to check back at the Spark MLlib website for updates and new features.</p>]]></content>
